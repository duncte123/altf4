# How to use?

1. Download the jar from the releases
2. Place it in a location where you can remember it exists
3. Write down the location. I placed it on my desktop so in my case the location is `"C:\Users\duncte\Desktop\altf4-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"` (shift-right click > copy as path on windows)
4. NOTE: altf4 is the project name, don't worry about the project actually pressing those keys without you noticing
5. Put the following in aitum as command `java -jar (location of jar, WITH QUOTES) a b c`
6. Run the rule, this will press the a, b and c keys on your keyboard and release them after a second

## Key not pressing
Some special keys are not supported by default, let me know if a key you want is missing and I'll add it asap.
